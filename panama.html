                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    <!--dates and abbreviations-->
                    Explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century, Panama broke with Spain 
                    in <time datetime="1821">1821</time> and joined a union of Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela 
                    - named the Republic of Gran Colombia. When the latter dissolved in <time datetime="1830">1830</time>, Panama remained 
                    part of Colombia. With <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> backing, Panama seceded from Colombia in <time datetime="1903">1903</time> and promptly signed 
                    a treaty with the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> allowing for the construction of a canal and <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> sovereignty over a strip of land 
                    on either side of the structure (the Panama Canal Zone).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Panama Canal was built by the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> Army Corps of Engineers between <time datetime="1904">1904</time> 
                    and <time datetime="1914">1914</time>. In <time datetime="1977">1977</time>, an agreement was signed for the complete transfer of the Canal 
                    from the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> to Panama by the end of the century. Certain portions of the Zone and increasing responsibility 
                    over the Canal were turned over in the subsequent decades. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> help, dictator Manuel NORIEGA was deposed in <time datetime="">1989</time>. 
                    The entire Panama Canal, the area supporting the Canal, and remaining <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> military bases 
                    were transferred to Panama by the end of <time datetime="1999">1999</time>. An ambitious expansion project to more than double 
                    the Canal's capacity - by allowing for more Canal transits and larger ships - was carried out between <time datetime="">2007</time> 
                    and <time datetime="2016">2016</time>.

                <h2>People and society</h2>
                    <h3>Demographic profile</h3>
                        <p>
                            Panama is a country of demographic and economic contrasts. It is in the midst of a demographic transition, 
                            characterized by steadily declining rates of fertility, mortality, and population growth, but disparities 
                            persist based on wealth, geography, and ethnicity. Panama has one of the fastest growing economies in Latin 
                            America and dedicates substantial funding to social programs, yet poverty and inequality remain prevalent. 
                            The indigenous population accounts for a growing share of Panama's poor and extreme poor, while the non-indigenous 
                            rural poor have been more successful at rising out of poverty through rural-to-urban labor migration. The 
                            government's large expenditures on untargeted, indirect subsidies for water, electricity, and fuel have been 
                            ineffective, but its conditional cash transfer program has shown some promise in helping to decrease extreme 
                            poverty among the indigenous population.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Panama has expanded access to education and clean water, but the availability of sanitation and, to a lesser 
                            extent, electricity remains poor. The increase in secondary schooling - led by female enrollment - is spreading 
                            to rural and indigenous areas, which probably will help to alleviate poverty if educational quality and the 
                            availability of skilled jobs improve. Inadequate access to sanitation contributes to a high incidence of diarrhea 
                            in Panama's children, which is one of the main causes of Panama's elevated chronic malnutrition rate, especially 
                            among indigenous communities.
