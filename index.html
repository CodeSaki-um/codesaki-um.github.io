                <h2>Water</h2>
                <p>Humans are made of mainly water and so is the planet we inhabit.</p>
                <p>It is normal to assume that plain water is the best option when </p>
                <p>caring for your plants. However, there are other options you can</p>
                <p>utilize to improve your plant's overall quality of life. Water's</p>
                <p>a great starting point, but filters and tubing can remove or add</p>
                <p>many minerals to the water. This will end up damaging the plant </p>
                <p>either way because it can intake harmful minerals, or not absorb</p>
                <p>enough of them. Plain water can be improved by adding sugar, but</p>
                <p>it is only a remedy, not a solution!</p>

                <h2>Rice Water</h2>
                
                <p>On the other hand, rice water is a step up from plain/sugar water</p>
                <h2>Milk</h2>
