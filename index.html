                <h2>Water</h2>
                <p>Humans are made of mainly water and so is the planet we inhabit.</p>
                <p>It is normal to assume that plain water is the best option when </p>
                <p>caring for your plants. However, there are other options you can</p>
                <p>utilize to improve your plant's overall quality of life. Water's</p>
                <p>a great starting point, but filters and tubing can remove or add</p>
                <p>many minerals to the water. This will end up damaging the plant </p>
                <p>either way because it can intake harmful minerals, or not absorb</p>
                <p>enough of them. Plain water can be improved upon, but one major </p>
                <p>misconception many have, is that adding sugar helps your plants.</p>
                <p>Sugar can alter the way your plants absorb water/nutrients, in  </p>
                <p>turn; this can cause healthy plants to start declining in health.</p>

                <h2>Rice Water</h2>

                <p>On the other hand, rice water <i>is</i> a step up from plain/sugar</p>
                <p>water. Dry rice is packed with many nutrients that is washed away </p>
                <p>when rinsed for consumption. Next time you find yourself washing a</p>
                <p>portion of rice, keep the water and watch how great your plants will</p>
                <p>look in no time. Your babies will be thanking you, try it out, see</p>
                <p>for yourself!</p>

                <h2>Milk</h2>
                <p>Milk might seem a little out of place, but today, crazy ideas are a</p>
                <p>new trend people like following. For the record, the nutrients milk</p>
                <p>has is barely beneficial or even accessible to human bodies let alone</p>
                <p>plants. To reiterate, your little leaf-babies do not want to drink </p>
                <p>milk...<b>ever</b>.</p>
