                            The Taino - indigenous inhabitants of Hispaniola prior to the arrival of Europeans - 
                            divided the island into five chiefdoms and territories. Christopher COLUMBUS explored 
                            and claimed the island on his first voyage in <time datetime="1492">1492</time>; it became a springboard for Spanish 
                            conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In <time datetime="1697">1697</time>, Spain recognized French 
                            dominion over the western third of the island, which in <time datetime="1804">1804</time> became Haiti. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The remainder of the island, by then known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence 
                            in <time datetime="1821">1821</time> but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally attained independence 
                            as the Dominican Republic in <time datetime="1844">1844</time>. In <time datetime="1861">1861</time>, the Dominicans voluntarily 
                            returned to the Spanish Empire, but two years later they launched a war that restored independence in <time datetime="1865">1865</time>. 
                            A legacy of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed, capped by the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas TRUJILLO from 
                            <time datetime="1930">1930</time> to <time datetime="1961">1961</time>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Juan BOSCH was elected president in <time datetime="1962">1962</time> but was deposed in a military coup in <time datetime="1963">1963</time>. 
                            In <time datetime="1965">1965</time>, the <abbr title="united states">US</abbr> led an intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an 
                            uprising to restore BOSCH. In <time datetime="1966">1966</time>, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in the presidential election. BALAGUER maintained 
                            a tight grip on power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed elections forced him to curtail his term in 
                            <time datetime="1996">1996</time>.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since then, regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition candidates have won the 
                            presidency. Former President Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna (first term <time datetime="1996">1996</time>-<time datetime="2000">2000</time>) won election to a new term 
                            in <time datetime="2004">2004</time> following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve more than one term, and was 
                            later reelected to a second consecutive term. Following the two-term presidency of Danilo MEDINA 
                            Sanchez (<time datetime="2012">2012</time>-<time datetime="2020">2020</time>), Luis Rodolfo ABINADER Corona was elected president in July <time datetime="2020-07">2020</time>.

                                    <p>Tier rating: Tier 2 Watch List — the Dominican Republic does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so; more 
                                        traffickers were convicted, two police officers were investigated for trafficking crimes, and cooperation with international law enforcement increased; officials identified more victims 
                                        and implemented new protections for vulnerable domestic workers. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        However, the government did not demonstrate overall increasing efforts, compared with the previous reporting period, to expand its anti-trafficking capacity; the government systemically 
                                        and persistently failed to screen vulnerable migrant or undocumented populations, failed to refer victims to services, and did not provide these groups with justice in trafficking crimes; 
                                        officials investigated and prosecuted fewer traffickers, did not adequately investigate labor trafficking cases involving migrants and children, and did not identify victims; the government 
                                        did not adopt draft amendments to improve anti-trafficking laws, did not adequately fund or provide resources to anti-trafficking efforts, and did not complete a new National Action Plan; 
                                        therefore, the Dominican Republic was downgraded to Tier 2 Watch List (<time datetime="2023">2023</time>).

                                    <p>Trafficking profile: human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in the Dominican Republic, and victims from the Dominican Republic are exploited abroad; Dominican women and 
                                        children, particularly from impoverished areas, were victims of sex trafficking throughout the Dominican Republic, the Caribbean, South and Central America, Europe, the Middle East, and the 
                                        US; a <time datetime="2022">2022</time> study found family networks, social media recruiting, domestic servitude, inequality, gender-based violence, lack of information and education, 
                                        and corruption were the primary causes of trafficking of Dominican women and girls in Costa Rica, Spain, and Switzerland.
