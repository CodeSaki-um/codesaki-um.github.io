                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    <!--dates and abbreviations-->
                    The Taino - indigenous inhabitants of Hispaniola prior to the arrival of Europeans - 
                    divided the island into five chiefdoms and territories. Christopher COLUMBUS explored 
                    and claimed the island on his first voyage in 1492; it became a springboard for Spanish 
                    conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain recognized French 
                    dominion over the western third of the island, which in 1804 became Haiti. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The remainder of the island, by then known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence 
                    in 1821 but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally attained independence 
                    as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In 1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish 
                    Empire, but two years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865. A legacy 
                    of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed, capped by the dictatorship of Rafael 
                    Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930 to 1961. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in 1963. In 1965, the 
                    US led an intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH. In 
                    1966, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in the presidential election. BALAGUER maintained a tight 
                    grip on power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed elections forced 
                    him to curtail his term in 1996.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition candidates have won the 
                    presidency. Former President Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna (first term 1996-2000) won election to a new term 
                    in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve more than one term, and was 
                    later reelected to a second consecutive term. Following the two-term presidency of Danilo MEDINA 
                    Sanchez (2012-2020), Luis Rodolfo ABINADER Corona was elected president in July 2020.

                <h2>People and society</h2>
                    <h3>Demographic profile</h3>
                        <p>
                            Panama is a country of demographic and economic contrasts. It is in the midst of a demographic transition, 
                            characterized by steadily declining rates of fertility, mortality, and population growth, but disparities 
                            persist based on wealth, geography, and ethnicity. Panama has one of the fastest growing economies in Latin 
                            America and dedicates substantial funding to social programs, yet poverty and inequality remain prevalent. 
                            The indigenous population accounts for a growing share of Panama's poor and extreme poor, while the non-indigenous 
                            rural poor have been more successful at rising out of poverty through rural-to-urban labor migration. The 
                            government's large expenditures on untargeted, indirect subsidies for water, electricity, and fuel have been 
                            ineffective, but its conditional cash transfer program has shown some promise in helping to decrease extreme 
                            poverty among the indigenous population.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Panama has expanded access to education and clean water, but the availability of sanitation and, to a lesser 
                            extent, electricity remains poor. The increase in secondary schooling - led by female enrollment - is spreading 
                            to rural and indigenous areas, which probably will help to alleviate poverty if educational quality and the 
                            availability of skilled jobs improve. Inadequate access to sanitation contributes to a high incidence of diarrhea 
                            in Panama's children, which is one of the main causes of Panama's elevated chronic malnutrition rate, especially 
                            among indigenous communities.
