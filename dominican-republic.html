                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    <!--dates and abbreviations-->
                    The Taino - indigenous inhabitants of Hispaniola prior to the arrival of Europeans - 
                    divided the island into five chiefdoms and territories. Christopher COLUMBUS explored 
                    and claimed the island on his first voyage in 1492; it became a springboard for Spanish 
                    conquest of the Caribbean and the American mainland. In 1697, Spain recognized French 
                    dominion over the western third of the island, which in 1804 became Haiti.

                    The remainder of the island, by then known as Santo Domingo, sought to gain its own independence 
                    in 1821 but was conquered and ruled by the Haitians for 22 years; it finally attained independence 
                    as the Dominican Republic in 1844. In 1861, the Dominicans voluntarily returned to the Spanish 
                    Empire, but two years later they launched a war that restored independence in 1865. A legacy 
                    of unsettled, mostly non-representative rule followed, capped by the dictatorship of Rafael 
                    Leonidas TRUJILLO from 1930 to 1961.

                    Juan BOSCH was elected president in 1962 but was deposed in a military coup in 1963. In 1965, the 
                    US led an intervention in the midst of a civil war sparked by an uprising to restore BOSCH. In 
                    1966, Joaquin BALAGUER defeated BOSCH in the presidential election. BALAGUER maintained a tight 
                    grip on power for most of the next 30 years when international reaction to flawed elections forced 
                    him to curtail his term in 1996.

                    Since then, regular competitive elections have been held in which opposition candidates have won the 
                    presidency. Former President Leonel FERNANDEZ Reyna (first term 1996-2000) won election to a new term 
                    in 2004 following a constitutional amendment allowing presidents to serve more than one term, and was 
                    later reelected to a second consecutive term. Following the two-term presidency of Danilo MEDINA 
                    Sanchez (2012-2020), Luis Rodolfo ABINADER Corona was elected president in July 2020.
